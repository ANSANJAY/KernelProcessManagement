Great! Let's break down your notes on the topic: "What happens when we do insmod on a module":

### **1. Technical Explanation** ðŸ“š

#### **Loading a Kernel Module with insmod**

**Kernel Module**: A kernel module is essentially a piece of code that can be dynamically inserted into or removed from the running Linux kernel. This allows for flexibility as features or drivers can be added without restarting the kernel.

Using `insmod` on a kernel module initiates the module insertion process:

**a)** The kernel is informed about the attempt to load a module through the `init_module()` function. This transfers control over to the kernel for further module handling.

**b)** Inside the kernel, the `sys_init_module()` function is called which handles the module loading process:

- First, it checks if the current user has the appropriate permissions to load the kernel module.
  
- Upon successful verification, the `load_module` function takes over:

  - It starts by allocating temporary memory in kernel space and then copies the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) module from user space to this kernel memory using `copy_from_user`.

  - The ELF file's integrity is checked to ensure it's a legitimate and correctly formatted file.

  - Based on the ELF's structure, offset is created in the allocated temporary memory, resulting in what's termed as 'convenience variables'.

  - Any arguments provided by the user for the module are also copied over to kernel memory.

  - A process termed 'symbol resolution' takes place, ensuring that all references in the module code can be appropriately addressed in the kernel space.

  - Once completed, the `load_module` function provides a reference to the now-loaded kernel module.

- The reference provided by `load_module` is then added to a doubly-linked list in the kernel. This list keeps track of all modules currently loaded.

- Finally, the `module_init` function specified within the module's code is called, initializing the module and setting it up for its intended functionality.

### **2. Curious Questions** ðŸ¤”

**Q1**: What is the main purpose of a kernel module?
**Answer**: A kernel module is a piece of code that can be dynamically inserted into or removed from the running Linux kernel, allowing the addition of features or drivers without restarting the kernel.

**Q2**: How does the kernel ensure that a user has the right permissions before loading a module?
**Answer**: The kernel checks permissions through the `sys_init_module()` function which verifies if the current user has the appropriate rights to load a module.

**Q3**: What does the `load_module` function do with the ELF file of a module?
**Answer**: The `load_module` function copies the ELF module from user space to kernel memory, checks its integrity to ensure it's correctly formatted, creates offsets based on its structure, and handles any provided user arguments. After this process, symbol resolution is performed, and a reference to the loaded module is returned.

### **3. Simple Words for Memory** ðŸ’¡

- **Kernel Module**: Think of it as a plug-in or an add-on for a software application, but for the kernel. Just as you can add or remove a plug-in to enhance the software, kernel modules can be added or removed to introduce new features or drivers.

- **insmod**: Imagine you have a toy (the kernel) and you want to attach a new part to it (the module). Using `insmod` is like pushing the new part into its place, making sure it fits and works perfectly with the toy.

- **ELF File and load_module**: Think of the ELF file as a puzzle piece. The `load_module` function's job is to ensure this piece fits perfectly into the puzzle (kernel) by checking its shape (sanity check) and finding the right spot for it (symbol resolution).

Remember, kernel modules offer flexibility to the Linux kernel, allowing it to adapt and extend its capabilities without requiring a full restart.
