Alright, let's break down the topic "Symbols From Another External Module" based on your provided template:

**1. Explain the technical concept:**

In the Linux kernel, when developing modules, there can be situations where one module might rely on symbols (essentially functions or variables) from another module. This interdependence can be problematic when building the module because the kernel's build system (`kbuild`) may not be aware of these external symbols. This could lead to warnings about 'undefined symbols'. 

To address this, whenever an external module is compiled, a `Module.symvers` file is generated. This file documents all the symbols that are exported by the module but not defined within the kernel. If one module relies on symbols from another module, it's important to make `kbuild` aware of this relationship to ensure a clean build without warnings or errors. You can use `KBUILD_EXTRA_SYMBOLS` to point `kbuild` to the `Module.symvers` file of the other module, so it's aware of all the necessary symbols.

**2. Curious Questions:**

- **Q:** What is the purpose of the `Module.symvers` file in Linux kernel module development?
  
  **A:** The `Module.symvers` file documents all the symbols that are exported by a module but not defined within the kernel itself. This file is essential when one module relies on symbols from another module, helping to ensure a clean build without warnings or errors.

- **Q:** What could be a potential issue if `kbuild` is not aware of all the symbols while building a module?
  
  **A:** If `kbuild` isn't aware of all the necessary symbols when building a module, it could spit out warnings or errors about 'undefined symbols', which could prevent the module from loading correctly or functioning as expected.

- **Q:** How can you make `kbuild` aware of external symbols from another module?

  **A:** You can use the `KBUILD_EXTRA_SYMBOLS` directive and provide it the path to the `Module.symvers` file of the other module. This way, `kbuild` will have the necessary knowledge of the symbols and will not produce warnings or errors related to them.

**3. Explain the concept in simple words so that I can remember it for my interview:**

Think of the Linux kernel modules as different teams working on a project. Sometimes, one team might need a tool or resource from another team. But if the management isn't aware of this need, there can be confusion or delays. The `Module.symvers` file is like a list of all the tools a team can offer to others. By using `KBUILD_EXTRA_SYMBOLS`, it's like telling the management, "Hey, we need this tool from that team!" This ensures everything runs smoothly without any hiccups. üõ†Ô∏èü§ùüèΩüë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
