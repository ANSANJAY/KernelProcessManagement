### 1. Explain the Technical Concept 📘
This code is a Linux Kernel Module that allows you to input a Process ID (PID) as a module parameter. When the module is loaded, it goes through all the tasks in the system using the `for_each_process` macro, looking for the task with the specified PID. Once found, it prints the name (command name) of the found task (process) and its parent task.

Here’s a breakdown of the essential parts of this module:
- `module_param(PID, uint, 0400);` allows the user to pass a PID as a parameter when loading the module. The parameter is a read-only (`0400`) unsigned integer.
- `print_task(struct task_struct *task)` is a helper function that prints the command name of the given task and its parent task.
- `init_find_task(void)` is the module initialization function that iterates through all the tasks and calls `print_task` for the task with the specified PID.
- `exit_find_task(void)` is the module exit function that prints a goodbye message when the module is removed.

### 2. Curious Questions 🤔
#### Q: What does `module_param(PID, uint, 0400);` do in this context?
**A:** It allows the user to input a PID when loading the module. `0400` specifies that this parameter is read-only.

#### Q: Why is `for_each_process` macro used, and what does it do in this kernel module?
**A:** `for_each_process` macro is used to iterate over all tasks in the system. It helps in finding the task with the specified PID in this module.

#### Q: What is the significance of `task->comm` and `task->parent->comm` in the `print_task` function?
**A:** `task->comm` provides the name of the task, and `task->parent->comm` provides the name of the parent task, allowing the module to print the names of the found task and its parent.

### 3. Explain the Concept in Simple Words 🌟
Imagine you are at a large family reunion 🌳, and you are given a task to find a relative (task) with a specific tag number (PID). You go around checking the tag number of each relative (process) 🏷️. Once you find your relative, you jot down their name 📝 (`task->comm`) and the name of their immediate parent 📝 (`task->parent->comm`). This is akin to what this kernel module does! It’s like a mini family detective 🕵️, searching for a family member based on a unique identifier and then noting down some information about them and their parent! When the detective is done, he says "GOOD BYE" to everyone at the reunion 👋.
