### 1. Explain the Technical Concept üìò
In Linux, `num_online_cpus()` is a function that returns the number of online CPUs in the system. In multiprocessor systems, this function is crucial to understand the system's parallel processing capabilities. An online CPU is one that is available for scheduling tasks; hence knowing the number of online CPUs is beneficial for load balancing and optimizing task scheduling.

The provided code snippet is a Linux Kernel Module that, when loaded, prints the number of online CPUs to the kernel log. This is done using `pr_info` in the `mod_init` function, which is called upon module initialization.

`pr_info` is a macro used to print kernel messages, and `module_init` and `module_exit` are macros used to load and unload the module respectively. `module_init` takes a function which is run when the module is loaded, and `module_exit` takes a function which is run when the module is removed.

### 2. Curious Questions ü§î
#### Q: What is the significance of `num_online_cpus()` in Linux Kernel Development?
**A:** `num_online_cpus()` is significant in Linux Kernel Development as it allows developers to acquire the number of online (available for scheduling) CPUs, enabling them to optimize and balance load efficiently across multiple processors. This is crucial for enhancing system performance in multiprocessor environments.

#### Q: How can the `num_online_cpus()` function be used to optimize task scheduling in multiprocessor systems?
**A:** The `num_online_cpus()` function can be used to optimize task scheduling by allowing the scheduling mechanism to allocate tasks effectively across the available CPUs, ensuring balanced load distribution and avoiding CPU overutilization, thus improving overall system performance and responsiveness.

#### Q: What will be the output of the provided module when loaded in a system having 4 online CPUs?
**A:** When the provided module is loaded in a system with 4 online CPUs, it will print ‚Äúnumber of online cpus is 4‚Äù to the kernel log using `pr_info`.

### 3. Explain the Concept in Simple Words üåü
Think of `num_online_cpus()` like a tool that tells us how many workers (CPUs) are available in our system workshop. If we know how many workers are available, we can distribute the work (tasks) more effectively among them. So, in simple words, this tool helps us know how many workers are there to share the load, so no one is overburdened, and work gets done faster and more efficiently! üõ†Ô∏è 

So, this code is like a manager entering the workshop, counting the number of available workers, and then announcing it so that everyone knows and can plan the work accordingly! üì¢
